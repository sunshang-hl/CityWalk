It covers a total area of 12.02 square kilometers and was partially completed and opened in 2010. The park is still under construction. The park has deep ditches and lush forests, with flowing water from time to time. The highest peak is Jigong Mountain, which is 445 meters above sea level. It is a green landscape in Shenzhen. The main construction contents of the park include the Yaochi Dicui Scenic Area under construction, the Dongri Lansheng Scenic Area that has been opened, the mountain greenway and the mountaineering trail. Park History In June and December 2004, the municipal government held two office meetings to study the relevant issues of accelerating the construction of country parks, and decided to agree to prepare for the construction of Yinhushan Country Park. In March 2005, the Municipal Development and Reform Bureau issued a document to formally approve the project of Yinhushan Country Park. In 2012, the Municipal Greening Management Office completed the construction of the Yinhushan section of the newly built Provincial Greenway Line 5 and handed it over to Yinhushan Park. In 2014, the construction of the park's winter scenic area and supporting facilities on the mountain began. At present, the construction of the winter scenic area has been basically completed. There are two entrances and exits to the mountain on the park greenway. Because there is no parking lot, it is inconvenient to drive by car. One of the entrances and exits is located next to the Bantian Zhengkeng Reservoir, and it is connected by Bantian Ring Road to Yongxiang Road. You can take a bus to the"Galite" station and walk 1.5 kilometers along the greenway sign to the entrance; the other is located next to the Yinhu Sanjiu dormitory, and go straight west from Jinhu Road to the second line. You can take a bus to the"City Rescue Station" and walk 1 kilometer along the greenway sign to the entrance. This section of the greenway is built from north to south along the halfway of Yinhu Mountain. The total length between the two entrances and exits is 11.265 kilometers. The ups and downs are relatively steep. The estimated climbing time is 3-4 hours, which is more suitable for family travel.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: 6:00-23:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(o,{id:"59",data:[{id:"Silver Lake Hill Country Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Silver Lake Hill Country Park")])),title1:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>[r(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Silver Lake Hill Country Park",description:"Greenway Hiking Trail: There is a greenway about 11 kilometers long and a 4-kilometer hiking trail on Yinhu Mountain, which is built along the mountain from Yinhu to Bantian.
