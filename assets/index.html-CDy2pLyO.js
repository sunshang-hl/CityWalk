It has accumulated a profound educational and cultural heritage and achieved fruitful results in running schools. It has won many honorary titles such as "Shenzhen School Efficiency Award", "Shenzhen Education Advanced Unit", "Good School for Citizens", and "National Youth Campus Football Specialty School". It enjoys the reputation of "the flower of eastern education" in the society. The school campus environment is beautiful and the hardware facilities are complete. The unique campus buildings and the green flowers and trees complement each other, and the intoxicating fragrance everywhere makes people feel relaxed and happy. The inspirational garden, the truth-seeking stone, the concept wall, the Xingzhi corridor, the Eight Elegant Corridor, the open reading room and the school history wall are scattered in every corner of the campus. Each attraction has a silent educational effect and enriches the spiritual world of students. The 400m standard sports field and the independent science and art building provide sufficient places for students to carry out sports and second-class activities. There are few junior high schools in Shenzhen that can meet such conditions. The school has a strong faculty. The current principal, Comrade Wang Jianjun, is a famous principal selected by Dapeng New District from the whole city. As a student of the first national backbone principal training class of the Central Party School, he has rich experience in education and teaching management and excellent school management ability. Under his leadership, all the faculty and staff of the school work together, strive for truth, strive for the first place, take the achievement of students as their responsibility, devote themselves to educating people, and make selfless contributions. In recent years, the teachers of the school have stood out in various competitions. In the 2016 Dapeng New District Junior High School Teachers' Skills Competition, they won 10 first places in 13 subject competitions; in the 2018 Dapeng New District Junior High School Teachers' Skills Competition, they won 5 first places in 8 subject competitions. 12 teachers of the school have won honors at the municipal level or above. For schools located in the remote eastern part of Shenzhen, every honor at the municipal level or above is condensed with hard sweat and unremitting persistence.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Weekdays: 6:00-7:00, 20:00-22:00"),t("li",null,"Forest Area Opening Hours: iShenzhen Appointment")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),o(s,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Kwai Chung Secondary School Sports Hall"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Kwai Chung Secondary School Sports Hall")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>[o(r,{image:"https://www.sz.gov.cn/img/4/4108/4108454/11169238.jpg",title:"Kwai Chung Secondary School Sports Hall",description:"Kwai Chung Middle School was founded in 1969.
