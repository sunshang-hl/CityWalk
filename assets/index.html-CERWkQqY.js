It is named Lianhuashan Park because of the seven hills embracing each other, which look like a blooming lotus. It was officially opened to the public in June 1997. Lianhuashan Park is an ecological municipal park, and also a"living museum" with beautiful scenery and pleasant environment where people and nature coexist harmoniously. With its unique geographical location and cultural landscape, it has become a window to show the style of Shenzhen. The number of visitors to the park is about 10 million each year. It has been rated as a"national key park","national red tourism demonstration base", 'Guangdong Province Patriotism Education Base" and"Shenzhen Party Member Education Base". Cultural activities: The Bougainvillea Flower Exhibition, which began in 1999, has been held for 24 consecutive sessions. It is a key flower exhibition that showcases the city's humanistic spirit and enhances the city's charm. The first to fourth sessions were held in Donghu Park, and the fifth session (2003) began to move to Lianhuashan Park, and the park's theme flower was gradually determined to be Bougainvillea. In order to implement the strategic goal of Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government to build a"world-famous flower city", the scale of the Bougainvillea Flower Exhibition has been completely upgraded and comprehensively expanded since 2018. From the initial flower quality and bonsai display, it has developed into a comprehensive urban flower exhibition integrating theme gardens, urban flower fairs, new and excellent variety displays and cultural activities. Focusing on the construction of"complex, life-oriented, and ecological" parks, it has introduced a new variety of life service content, held a nature education carnival and a nature science exhibition, and introduced a creative life market. It is a grand flower-viewing carnival that integrates sightseeing, entertainment, and fun, and has also become an annual city-wide event.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: 6:00 - 23:00, admission is stopped at 22:30 (square dancing and group exercises are prohibited in the entire park)")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"tour-route",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#tour-route"},[t("span",null,"Tour Route")])],-1)),r(o,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/attachment/1/1334/1334616/10775278.png",title:"Lianhuashan Park游玩路径图",description:"游玩路径示意图"}),e[56]||(e[56]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(s,{id:"68",data:[{id:"Lianhuashan Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Lianhuashan Park")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>[r(o,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Lianhuashan Park",description:"The eastern area has two major scenic spots,'Dawn Breeze and Sunrise' and 'Rainforest Valley'.
