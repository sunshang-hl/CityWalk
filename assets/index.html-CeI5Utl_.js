It connects Maozhou River, Jieliu River, Haoxiang River, and Haoxiang Lake into a belt, combining water management and production management to create a smart manufacturing new city that integrates the three lives and is livable and happy. The park revolves around the theme of"Bicheng Hub•Oyster Township Rebirth", and comprehensively creates a charming oyster township from four aspects: driving industry, improving transportation, reconstructing water veins, and inheriting culture. The cultural and creative exhibition hall project transformed from a power plant in the park was shortlisted for this year"s British design authority Dezeen Awards, and was divided into the landscape project category and the regeneration project category.
