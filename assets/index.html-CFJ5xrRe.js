It is located at the intersection of Bao'an District, Longhua District and Nanshan District, and is known as the"oxygen bar in the city". Yangtaishan has two peaks. Climbing from Bao'an Shiyan Square to the top of the mountain, it is the big Yangtai, known as the"first peak in western Shenzhen", with an altitude of 587.1 meters; climbing from Longhua Dalang Square to the top of the mountain is the small Yangtai, with an altitude of 460.7 meters; the ridge trails between the two mountains are connected, reflecting each other from afar. There are 5 small and medium-sized reservoirs and more than 20 mountain springs and streams in the park. It is the source of rivers such as Shiyan River, Baimang River, Mashan River, Maozhou River, etc. in Shenzhen, and it is the upstream water source of Shiyan Reservoir, Xili Reservoir and Tiegang Reservoir. The park is rich in wild animal and plant resources. According to surveys and statistics, there are 452 species of higher plants in 114 families, 82 species of vertebrates, and 8 species of animals and plants under national key protection. The park has lush natural vegetation and beautiful ecological scenery. From a distance, it is vast and green, and from a close distance, there are strange rocks and stones. There are deep valleys and gullies in the mountains, winding streams, ancient trees and vines, birds singing and flowers blooming; the lake at the foot of the mountain is clear and green, and the greenway is winding. The scenery is foggy or cloudy in all seasons, and it is suitable for sunny and rainy days. The humanities and history are profound and far-reaching. The head of the mountain is where the Hakka ancestors once cultivated land by slashing and burning. They knocked stones to build houses and cut firewood to cook smoke; they sang folk songs and fog, and danced with unicorns; they passed on the relics of gods by word of mouth. During the Anti-Japanese War, the towering Yangtai Mountain was the base of the Red Armed Dongjiang Column. The column rescued a large number of well-known patriotic celebrities and cultural giants at home and abroad, such as Mao Dun, Zou Taofen, and He Xiangning, from Hong Kong occupied by the Japanese invaders, and transferred and hid in this mountain, which was the"Victory Rescue". Therefore, Yangtai Mountain is also known as the"Hero Mountain". Yangtai Mountain was formerly known as"Yangtai Mountain". In June 2020, with the approval of the Shenzhen Municipal Government, the name of"Yangtai Mountain" was restored to"Yangtai Mountain". After the restoration of the place name, in order to maintain the original appearance of some scenic spots and buildings, the words"Yangtai Mountain" on the archway of Shiyan Square, as well as the words"Yangtai Mountain Forest Park" and"Yangtai Diecui" inscribed by former Vice Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua, are still retained.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening
