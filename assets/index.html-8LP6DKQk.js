It is a large modern cultural facility invested and rebuilt by the Shenzhen Municipal Government on the site of the original Shenzhen Library. It covers an area of 22,000 square meters and a building area of 15,600 square meters. It was officially opened on April 23, 2009. It is located next to the beautiful Shenzhen Litchi Park, with dense shade and green grass, elegant environment, quiet in the bustling city, and a combination of beautiful natural landscape and rich cultural atmosphere. It is a pearl in the downtown of Shenzhen. As the only independent document information center in Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Hong Kong and Macao that serves children, parents and educators, the new Shenzhen Children's Library has complete facilities and functions. The library provides all-round and three-dimensional services according to different service objects and document characteristics, and opens multiple reading areas such as the lending area, newspaper and magazine reading area, online learning area, visually impaired reading area, Chinese studies hall, children's borrowing area, parent-child reading area, reading world, and international education resource hall. At the same time, there are service areas such as multi-functional lecture hall, reading practice center, and under the plane tree. The library currently has a collection of 1.4 million documents (paper), a designed collection of 1.6 million, 1,100 journals and newspapers, 1,200 reader seats, and receives an average of 5,000 readers per day. Shenzhen Children's Library adheres to the concept of "happy reading, natural life, and healthy growth" to provide readers with simple and fast services. Except for Monday, it is open to the public from 9:00 to 21:00 every day, providing 72 hours of service per week. In terms of service methods, it implements free services, establishes a "reading points system", provides online renewal, telephone renewal and other services, and carries out online information and digital document reading services. Shenzhen Children's Library is not only a storage, circulation, retrieval and consultation center for various children's literature and materials, but also a place for children's reading activities. The library holds a series of activities including theatre performances, lectures, essay competitions, exhibitions and public reading practice all year round. It also innovatively holds activities such as the "Shenzhen Children Welcome the Universiade, and the Universiade's Footprints Reflect the City of Shenzhen" children's art creation competition and the famous works new edition competition to achieve interaction between the library and readers and provide a stage for readers to exercise and display themselves. By organizing reading activities such as Sister Hong's storytelling, Mother's Day, Father's Day, summer special events, and "4?23 World Book Day", we encourage children to read more and read good books. Shenzhen Children's Library's "Bougainvillea" Youth Classic Reading Program, "Ivy" Literature Resource Co-construction and Sharing Program, "Dandelion" Care Program for Children of Migrant Workers, "Carnation" Non-discriminatory Reading Program, "Sunflower" Shenzhen Childhood Collection Program, etc., have been warmly welcomed and praised by Shenzhen youth and their parents. In 2010, the self-developed one-stop digital resource reading platform, "e-Reading Station", was launched, and "e-Reading Book" was developed to provide all-weather uninterrupted reading services. In 2011, Shenzhen Children's Library launched a new "Happy Reading 365" - parent-child reading program, created the Love Reading Network and Joy Weibo, recommended a good book every day, and carried out reading guidance activities. Adhering to the purpose of serving children and their workers and parents wholeheartedly, Shenzhen Children's Library has also made achievements in academic research. In 1998, the second edition of "Chinese Library Book Classification - Children's Library (Primary and Secondary School Library Edition)" was revised, and in 2004, the "Chinese Children's Literature Classification Thesaurus" was compiled and published. At the same time, Shenzhen Children's Library took the lead in completing the design, organization and construction of the key cultural research project of the Ministry of Culture of China, "China Children's Information World - Online Library", and was awarded the "China Digital Library Children's Central Library" by the China Digital Library. If the youth are wise, the country will be wise; if the youth are strong, the country will be strong. Shenzhen Children's Library will continue to strengthen public cultural services, promote the ideological and moral construction of minors, become a happy reading paradise for children across the city, and provide document support and information services for parents and children's educators.`,-1)])),tab2:n(({value:a,isActive:t})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[i("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[i("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[i("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),i("ul",null,[i("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Tuesday to Sunday: 9:00-21:00 Legal holidays: 10:00-16:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=i("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[i("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[i("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),l(o,{id:"59",data:[{id:"Shenzhen Children's Library"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:n(({value:a,isActive:t})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[r("Shenzhen Children's Library")])),title1:n(({value:a,isActive:t})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[r("To be updated")])),tab0:n(({value:a,isActive:t})=>[l(s,{image:"https://www.sz.gov.cn/img/4/4218/4218621/11634082.png",title:"Shenzhen Children's Library",description:"Shenzhen Children's Library is located at No. 1011 Hongli Road, Futian District, Shenzhen.
