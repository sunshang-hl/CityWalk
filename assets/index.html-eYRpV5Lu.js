It is currently a small natural mountain with an area of about 56,000 square meters. The mountain is well covered with vegetation and has a natural harbor, which is suitable for the survival and reproduction of birds. There are many kinds of birds living on it. In order to protect the excellent natural environment of the place, meet the leisure requirements of surrounding residents, and accelerate the pace of international urban development, Yantian District has established a project to build Yandunshan International Friendship Park. Drawing on the construction experience of excellent international friendship parks and ecological parks in China, it takes ecology and international friendship as the theme, and implants elements such as popular science education to build it into a first-class international park. The park is divided into three theme areas:"Ecological Friendship","International Friendship" and"Peace Friendship". Through the transformation or construction of new structures and sketches, the characteristics of each theme area are displayed; at the same time, the mountain trail and the coastal plank road are connected to form an organic whole; in addition, the park will also renovate several buildings in the main entrance area that have been in disrepair for a long time, revitalize the functions and roles of the buildings, and use them to serve tourists and popular science education, etc., to improve the overall function of the park.',-1)])),tab2:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Open all day")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(s,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Yandunshan International Friendship Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Yandunshan International Friendship Park")])),title1:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>[r(o,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Yandunshan International Friendship Park",description:"The International Friendship Theme Area is designed based on the historical, cultural and artistic elements of La Coruña, the first city to establish friendly relations with Yantian.
