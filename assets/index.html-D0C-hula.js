In order to implement the scientific development concept, improve the ecological environment, and respond to the call of the Ministry of Water Resources to build soil and water conservation technology demonstration parks across the country, in accordance with the relevant arrangements of the municipal government, Shenzhen Water Affairs Bureau and Nanshan District People's Government started the construction of Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Park in 2008, and the park was opened to the public in October 2009. Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Park is the first demonstration park in my country with the theme of urban soil and water conservation work. It focuses on displaying the achievements of Shenzhen's soil and water conservation work since the 1990s. It is an important base and display window for Shenzhen to promote ecological civilization construction and water situation education and publicity. In March 2009, Shenzhen Water Conservation Park was named"National Soil and Water Conservation Science and Technology Demonstration Shenzhen Water Conservation Park" by the Ministry of Water Resources; in February 2012, it was jointly named"National Soil and Water Conservation Education Social Practice Base for Primary and Secondary School Students" by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Education; in July 2012, it was awarded the"Chairman"s Award" in the 9th International Landscape Management Category by the Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA); in April 2013, it was listed as the 'Guangdong Province Soil and Water Loss Monitoring Point of the National Soil and Water Conservation Monitoring Network and Information System Construction (Phase II) Project'; in May 2016, it was named"National Water Situation Education Base" by the Ministry of Water Resources; in November 2017, it was rated as the"National Soil and Water Conservation Science Education Base" by the China Soil and Water Conservation Society; in November 2017, it became a"member unit of the National Water Conservancy Museum Alliance"; in October 2020, it became the"Nanshan District Young Pioneers Off-campus Practice Base". Cultural activities: Shenzhen Water Conservation Park holds special education and publicity activities every year, targeting different social groups such as primary and secondary school students and the public, and carries out theme activities such as"True Protection, Love My Water and Soil","Love Water and Protect Soil, It"s Your Responsibility, Start with Every Little Thing to Do to Protect Forests and Greenery","Youth in Action, Dedicate Beautiful Water to Shenzhen" and so on;"Water and Soil Conservation Enters the Community","Find the Most Beautiful Things Around You, Show the Original Ecology of the City""Creative Cup" Photography Competition,"Ecological New Year"s Day, Fun Water Conservation Tour" Ecological Garden Party,"World Water Day","China Water Week" theme activities,"National Urban Water Conservation Promotion Week","Water and Soil Conservation Enters Campus","Building Dreams in Shenzhen, Love Water Conservation" hand-painted competition publicity activities and other theme publicity activities with rich content and novel forms, and strive to build a national publicity and education system of 'everyone participates, everyone benefits".`,-1)])),tab2:n(({value:i,isActive:a})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Tuesday to Sunday 9:00-17:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(s,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Technology Demonstration Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:n(({value:i,isActive:a})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[o("Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Technology Demonstration Park")])),title1:n(({value:i,isActive:a})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[o("To be updated")])),tab0:n(({value:i,isActive:a})=>[r(l,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Technology Demonstration Park",description:"1.

(2) Plant root box display facilities use transparent plant root boxes to display the root morphology and growth conditions of different vegetation types. (3) The soil and water conservation engineering measures display area takes engineering and plant measures as the two main lines, and sets up slope protection engineering and ditch protection engineering display areas to display traditional soil and water conservation technical measures and modern urban soil and water conservation technical measures. On the one hand, it allows visitors to systematically understand various soil and water conservation measures, and on the other hand, it highlights the regional and targeted nature of various soil and water conservation measures.
