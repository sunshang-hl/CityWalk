OCT Wetland is a coastal wetland that integrates ecological tourism and nature education functions. It is also an important transit station and habitat for international migratory birds. In 2020, OCT Wetland passed the inspection and acceptance of the inspection team of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration and became the only national wetland park in Shenzhen. OCT Wetland has received widespread attention and recognition from the society for its outstanding contributions in nature education, community services, public welfare platform building, and ecological protection. It has won many honorary titles such as"National Coastal Wetland Restoration Demonstration Project',"Chinese Habitat Environment Model Award", and"National Primary and Secondary School Environmental Education Social Practice Base". Over the past eight years, OCT Wetland Nature School has cultivated more than 600 volunteers, contributed more than 40,000 volunteer services, served for 150,000 hours, carried out nearly 10,000 educational activities, and affected more than 10 million people. Cultural Activities Since its establishment in 2014, OCT Wetland Nature School has been committed to training environmental volunteer teachers, developing courses and activities, and leading the public to learn in nature. OCT Wetland has now become an ideal place for bird watching, fish watching, insect watching, and nature watching, and an ideal experimental base for primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities to carry out teaching and scientific research."Experiential teaching materials" include courses, activities, and lectures. They are the most important and distinctive"teaching materials" of OCT Wetland Nature School. Written teaching materials provide theoretical guidance for"experiential teaching materials". OCT Wetland Nature School has worked with environmental volunteer classrooms to develop a diversified curriculum system for different ages and seasons. At present, more than ten themed natural classrooms have been developed, including ecological tours, natural fun classrooms, zero waste courses, bird classrooms, mangrove courses, traceless wetlands, and ecological lectures.`,-1)])),tab2:a(({value:n,isActive:i})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays 9:30-17:00 (last admission at 16:30) Reservations are required for admission")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"tour-route",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#tour-route"},[t("span",null,"Tour Route")])],-1)),r(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/attachment/1/1334/1334197/10774982.jpg",title:"Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town National Wetland Park, Guangdong游玩路径图",description:"游玩路径示意图"}),e[56]||(e[56]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(o,{id:"68",data:[{id:"Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town National Wetland Park, Guangdong"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:a(({value:n,isActive:i})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town National Wetland Park, Guangdong")])),title1:a(({value:n,isActive:i})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:a(({value:n,isActive:i})=>[r(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Shenzhen Overseas Chinese Town National Wetland Park, Guangdong",description:"The wooden boardwalk of Mangrove Warblers is the first viewing point when entering the OCT Wetland.
