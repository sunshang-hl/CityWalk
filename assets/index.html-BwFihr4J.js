The overall terrain is low in the middle and high around. It is composed of mountains, hills, water bodies, etc. The terrain is varied and has a good natural landscape framework. During the planning and design stage of the botanical garden, Professor Meng Zhaozhen (now an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering) presided over the overall planning and design. Based on the important ancient Chinese garden theory and the concept of"appropriate site selection and appropriate garden construction" in the gardening monograph"Yuan Ye" (written by Ji Cheng in the Ming Dynasty and completed in 1631), starting from the two aspects of site selection and garden construction, the"Xianhu" surrounded by mountains and water is constructed as the center of the whole garden. At the same time, the principle of"adapting to local conditions, following the situation, being clever in borrowing, and creating scenery according to the environment' in the Chinese classical gardening technique is used as the guiding ideology of planning and design. Pavilions, platforms, towers, and pavilions are set up in the waterside areas, mountainsides and some small hills with good landscape views to become scenic spots. The buildings are mainly in the flat, stable and generous style of the north, with white walls and yellow tiles (glazed tiles). At the viewing point, you can see the beautiful Xianhu Lake up close and the towering mountains, Shenzhen Reservoir and the city center in the distance, achieving the landscape effect of"clear mountains and blue sky as far as the eye can see"; on this basis, adhering to the concept of 'combining with nature and respecting nature', plant gardens with rich scientific connotations are embedded around the lake area and in the valley, and the scenic spots, scenic areas and plant gardens are organically connected into a whole through road systems at all levels, eventually forming an organism with interconnected ecological landscape points, ecological landscape lines and ecological landscape forests, making Xianhu Botanical Garden a botanical garden with beautiful scenery and rich scientific connotations. Cultural activities 1.
