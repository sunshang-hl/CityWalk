The park is rich in natural resources, with ancient volcanic relics from billions of years ago, beautiful coastal landforms, 98% forest coverage, thousands of plant species, and more than 200 animal species, making it a natural classroom for nature education. The park currently has two mountaineering expedition lines open. The Geopark Museum is the only geological theme science museum in the city and an important window for citizens and tourists to explore the mysteries of the earth. Since its opening, it has been awarded the honorary titles of"Land and Resources Science Popularization Base", 'Guangdong Province Science Popularization Education Base", 'Guangdong Province Natural Education Base", 'Guangdong Province Primary and Secondary School Students Research and Practice Education Base", and"Shenzhen Top Ten Science Popularization Bases". The cultural activity park has successively launched popular science books such as"Beautiful Coast Rocks Are Like This","Dreamlike Qiniang Mountain Rocks Are Like This","Natural Exploration Tour of Geopark-Qiniang Mountain Stream", and a series of popular science products such as"Geological Park Science Popularization Learning Card","Shenzhen Dapeng Peninsula National Geopark Guide", and"Shenzhen Dapeng Peninsula National Geopark Museum" Tour Manual. During the annual"World Earth Day","National Science Popularization Day" and other theme days and during the winter and summer vacations, various nature education activities are carried out, such as"I am a Forest Ranger for a Day","Geology One-Day Study Camp","Secrets of Qiniangshan Forest","How Much Do You Know About Minerals", etc. The themes cover minerals, gems, paleontological fossils, plants, forest fire prevention, etc., and the forms include exhibitions, lectures, answering questions, experiments, and experiences. Among them,"I am a Forest Ranger for a Day" and"Geology One-Day Study Camp" were rated as"Shenzhen's Excellent Nature Education Activity Model".`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:n,isActive:t})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[a("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[a("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),a("ul",null,[a("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: The main peak expedition line and the Luyan expedition line are completely closed (the museum scenic area is open as usual)")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=a("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[a("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(o,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Dapeng Peninsula National Geopark"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:n,isActive:t})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Dapeng Peninsula National Geopark")])),title1:i(({value:n,isActive:t})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:n,isActive:t})=>[r(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Dapeng Peninsula National Geopark",description:"The park is rich in natural resources.
