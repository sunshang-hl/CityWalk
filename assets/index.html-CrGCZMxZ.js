It starts from Xincheng Park in the west, connects to Marathon Mountain and Lake Greenway in the east, and faces Gongming Reservoir in the north, covering an area of about 410 hectares. There are 16 different forms of vertical transportation along the aerial trestle, which are connected to the ground park. On average, there is an entrance and exit every 200 meters, including vertical elevators, roof steps, circular ramps, spiral stairs, etc. Hongqiao Park consists of three areas, namely the entrance area, the Bihu area and the forest area from west to east. The three areas are connected by a red aerial trestle about 4,000 meters long. Hongqiao Park is known as the"Guangming Red Ribbon". Surrounded by green parks, the Hongqiao Bridge is about 4 kilometers long. It takes about 2 hours to walk the whole way back and forth. You will see different mountain and forest scenery along the way. You can also see golf courses along the way, which feels like walking in a natural oxygen bar. Entrance area: The entrance square mainly uses artistic terrazzo flooring, which serves as a link between the city and the forest, and is shaded by a series of green trees. Various flowering and foliage-viewing trees are planted in the surrounding green space. The Visitor Service Center covers an area of 548 square meters and extends from the Rainbow Bridge to the square. The roof of the Visitor Center is transformed into a large staircase, which has both transportation and viewing functions. Visitors can climb the stairs to the bridge. In the multi-functional sports field, a double-layer spiral staircase connects the Rainbow Bridge. Visitors can spiral up to enjoy 360° multi-angle views of various sports such as basketball, tennis, gateball, and volleyball. Bihu District: The Rainbow Bridge"floats into" the Bihu District. The Bihu District is centered on the Biyan Reservoir, and the fast and slow separated ring roads around the reservoir. The reservoir has a normal water level area of about 115,600 square meters, and the ring road is about 2,400 meters long and 6 meters wide. Surrounding the reservoir, there are five sports fields along the ring road (Phase II construction content). At the commanding height of Bihu District and the end of the Dadingling Greenway, two 35-meter-high sightseeing towers, a panoramic tower and a terminal tower, are set up for tourists to overlook the natural landscape of Bihu District and Dadingling, and the city skyline of Guangming Central District. Forest District: There are forest trails with a total length of about 5,400 meters in the forest district. Dirt roads and gravel roads are guided by signs, providing forest-loving tourists with a closer experience to nature. In addition to Hongqiao, you can also appreciate the magic and mystery of Dadingling in this original way.',-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Park area: 6:00-22:00, forest area: 6:00-19:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),l(o,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Hongqiao Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[r("Hongqiao Park")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[r("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>[l(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Hongqiao Park",description:"The Hongqiao Bridge is 4 kilometers long, 5 meters wide, and 8 meters high on average.
