Although the school is small and relatively remote, it has the cordial care of leaders at all levels, the selfless dedication of successive principals and all faculty and staff. At present, Xiyong Primary School has developed well overall and can fully meet the needs of children in the community for high-quality places. It is a good school close to the citizens. The school was founded in 1950. After several relocations, it moved to Xiyong Community in 1983. It is a small-scale school with a long history. The school covers an area of 6,230 square meters, a building area of 4,215 square meters, and a sports field area of 2,920 square meters. There are currently 6 teaching classes, 195 students, and 26 faculty and staff, including 1 principal and 21 full-time teachers, all of whom have college degrees or above, 1 master's degree, 16 bachelor's degrees, and 12 senior primary school teachers. In the new era and new journey, the school adheres to the school-running philosophy of "authentic education flies with me", implements the strategy of developing schools through scientific research, explores new paths for the characteristic development of small-scale schools under the background of the "double reduction" policy, and is committed to running a modern, boutique, small-scale school with "beautiful environment, excellent quality and distinctive characteristics". We strive to ensure that every child enjoys fair and quality education. In recent years, the school's management level has been continuously improved: it has successively won the titles of National Rope Skipping Strong Heart Program Pilot School, Guangdong Province Green School, Shenzhen Drug Prevention Demonstration School, Shenzhen Smoke-Free School, Dapeng New District Safe Campus, Dapeng New District Moral Education Featured School, and Rule of Law Demonstration School and other district-level and above honors. From September 2019 to December 2021, 126 teachers of our school won awards at the district level or above, including 19 at the municipal level or above, 275 students won awards at the district level or above, including 29 at the municipal level or above, and the school won 16 collective awards at the district level or above. This is exciting for Xichong Primary School, which has only 22 teachers and 195 students, and fully reflects the spirit of our teachers and students to strive for excellence and thrive.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:l})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Weekdays: 6:00-7:00, 19:30-21:30"),t("li",null,"Forest Area Opening Hours: iShenzhen Appointment")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),o(s,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Xichong Primary School Sports Center"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:l})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[n("Xichong Primary School Sports Center")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:l})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[n("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:l})=>[o(r,{image:"https://www.sz.gov.cn/img/4/4108/4108446/11168745.jpg",title:"Xichong Primary School Sports Center",description:"The environment is quiet and it is a small-scale school with unique characteristics.
