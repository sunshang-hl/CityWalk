The park is located in Futian District, starting from Binhe Road in the south, Sungang Road in the north, Huafu Road in the east, and Huanggang Road in the west. It is about 2.5 kilometers long from north to south and about 800 meters wide at its widest point from east to west. It was rebuilt into a municipal park in 1999 and officially opened on September 28 of the same year. The Central Park takes advocating nature and learning from nature as the guiding ideology of gardening. It mainly uses plants to create landscapes, making full use of the diversity of natural plant shapes and seasonal changes to create landscapes. The periphery of the park is a sparse forest lawn cultivated with palm plants as the main trunk tree species, forming a southern subtropical jungle scenery. The central part is a central lawn surrounded by dense forests, which opens up a quiet space in the downtown area while creating a forest. There are also artificial lakes, national fitness parks, etc. With the development of Shenzhen society, park culture has been continuously accumulated, and park facilities have been continuously improved. Various fitness equipment, sports facilities (tennis courts, football fields, basketball courts), and cultural squares have provided convenience for citizens' sports and fitness activities. The park has a sculpture scenic area. Futian River Basin Landscape, Urban Sculpture Landscape, Tropical Garden Landscape. Five meaningful urban sculptures: 1997 Return Sculpture, True Hero, Deep Blue (USA), Power (Germany), Pursuit (France). The Historical Central Park was one of the key projects of the Shenzhen Municipal Government in 1999 to do practical things for the people. Soon after its completion, Zhu Rongji, Li Peng and other central leaders visited and gave full affirmation. The guiding ideology of the planning and design follows the principles of biodiversity and landscape diversity to form a space for the symbiosis of people, plants and animals; starting from the ecology of local plant populations, grasping the ecological community habitat, and forming an ecological plant landscaping system. After completion, it will become a rare health and leisure green space and public entertainment venue in the city center, forming a scenic corridor in the city center. Based on the principle of"learning from nature and returning to nature", all hard landscape designs use natural materials, and use modern design techniques such as symmetry, variation, combination, superposition, deconstruction, etc., to strive to create new ideas and form a distinctive modern garden landscape.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:n,isActive:a})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening
