During this period, it has been moved around several times and changed its location several times. From the initial private school to the complete primary school, it has been through wind and rain and struggled all the way. In August 1995, the new school building was built and put into use. In August 1995, the former village Yangmeikeng Primary School (teaching point), in August 2000, the former village Dongshan Primary School and Nanping Primary School, and in August 2013, the former village Xichong Primary School were merged into Nanxiao, becoming the only public primary school in Nan'ao. The buildings of Nanxiao are like Kunpeng spreading its wings, trying to fly high. The campus is lush and green, and the environment is quiet. The teachers are rigorous in their studies and teach well, and students have come out of this and become leaders on all fronts. Since the 1980s, under the leadership of successive principals He You, Chen Suming, and He Jianhao, the campus has become more and more perfect over the years, with green shades and the fragrance of books. In recent years, the school has been adhering to the concept of 'immersing in marine culture, learning to be a person before learning skills', establishing a foundation for innovation, keeping pace with the times, condensing marine culture, exploring 'inclusive courses', and striving to create high-quality clubs. With distinctive school-running, the school vision is achieved, and teachers and students are led to 'willing to accommodate and integrate'. The people of Nanxiao will carry on the past and forge ahead into the future, set high goals, ride the wind and waves, persevere, and create new glory together. School philosophy: immerse in marine culture, learn to be a person first and then learn skills. Cultivate students' marine spirit of 'broadness, tolerance, self-confidence, enterprising, creativity, and dedication', and be a person with a sense of the sea and a person with a sense of social responsibility. The school adheres to the school motto of "Habits determine destiny, responsibility creates the future", adheres to the school-running goal of "taking the road of Nan'ao characteristics, becoming a Dapeng brand star, and entering the ranks of famous schools in Shenzhen", and realizes the educational goal of "being both moral and talented, with morality first". With scientific research as the guide and quality as life, the school comprehensively implements quality education and cultivates students into "tolerant, grateful, self-reliant, and enterprising" Shenzhen citizens with specialties in arts and sports.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: Weekdays: 6:00-7:00, 18:30-20:30"),t("li",null,"Forest Area Opening Hours: iShenzhen Appointment")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),l(r,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Nan'ao Central Primary School Sports Stadium"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[o("Nan'ao Central Primary School Sports Stadium")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[o("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>[l(s,{image:"https://www.sz.gov.cn/img/4/4108/4108410/11169234.jpg",title:"Nan'ao Central Primary School Sports Stadium",description:"Nan'ao Central Primary School was founded in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932).
