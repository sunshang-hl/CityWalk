The Lixin Lake Park (Phase III and IV) scenic area is located at the intersection of Fuzhou Avenue and Zhengfeng North Road, adjacent to Wangniu Pavilion in the south and overlooking the Pearl River Estuary in the west. The park construction transforms the closed protection into ecological perspective protection by borrowing the scenery of Lixin Lake, combining the design requirements and concepts of modern parks, and supplemented by the humanistic spirit of Fuyong, thus realizing an ecological landscape where water can be viewed but not touched. At the same time, the scenic greenway has set up scenic spots such as forest plank roads, landscape platforms, lakeside trails, and outdoor squares according to local conditions.

By setting up greenways, lakeside trails, wooden plank roads, etc., people can feel the different characteristics of the waterfront landscape.

In Lixin Lake Park (Phase III and IV), in front of Jianyue Book Bar, along the lakeside, the Lixin Lake Rose Garden is built.
