Three bridges, predominantly white in color—the Floating Bridge, the Exploration Bridge, and the Suspension Bridge—wind through the lush greenery, blending seamlessly with the forest, creating a delightful scene that has become a popular spot for residents and tourists to take photos. The middle section of the greenway connects to the endpoint of the Rainbow Bridge Park. The Rainbow Bridge, positioned as "Green Wilderness Guangming, the Pinnacle of Ecology," is planned with "one axis and three zones." The main axis, the Rainbow Bridge, is 4 kilometers long, 5 meters wide, and averages 8 meters in height, with the overall slope angle of the bridge deck controlled within 5.8 degrees. It links the entrance area, the Bihu Lake area, and the forest area. As a representative landscape structure within the greenway, the Rainbow Bridge connects the park, the city, and the forest, meandering between urban and natural spaces like a red ribbon drifting into the distance, complementing the verdant forest scenery.',-1)])),tab2:t(({value:a,isActive:i})=>n[5]||(n[5]=[e("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[e("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),e("ul",null,[e("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: To be updated."),e("li",null,"Weekday Opening Hours: To be updated.")],-1)])),_:1}),n[55]||(n[55]=e("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[e("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),l(o,{id:"74",data:[{id:"Dadingling Greenway and Hongqiao Park"},{id:"To be updated."}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:t(({value:a,isActive:i})=>n[6]||(n[6]=[r("Dadingling Greenway and Hongqiao Park")])),title1:t(({value:a,isActive:i})=>n[7]||(n[7]=[r("To be updated.")])),tab0:t(({value:a,isActive:i})=>[l(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/attachment/1/1335/1335466/10701533.jpg",title:"Dadingling Greenway and Hongqiao Park",description:"' Green with a path, and a path with scenery.
