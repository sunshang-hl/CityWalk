It covers an area of 193.21 hectares and is the earliest comprehensive municipal park established in Shenzhen. East Lake Park was originally named"Reservoir Park" and was built in 1961. In order to solve the problem of drinking water for Hong Kong compatriots, Premier Zhou Enlai personally instructed the construction of Shenzhen Reservoir. Comrade Tao Zhu, then the first secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, presided over the construction of Shenzhen Reservoir and built scenic spots such as Lao Le Pavilion, Hua Ting, Red Building, and Long Corridor on the Chigeng Mountain beside the reservoir, forming the Chigeng Mountain Scenic Area. In May 1963, former Vice President Dong Biwu inspected the reservoir and personally inscribed"Lao Le Pavilion" to commemorate and praise the merits of Bao'an people in building Shenzhen Reservoir. In 1966, Shenzhen Reservoir Park was officially opened to the public and became a good place for Shenzhen citizens and Hong Kong compatriots to visit and travel. This is the predecessor of today"s East Lake Park. In June 1978, the Shenzhen Reservoir Park Management Office was established, and in October 1984, it was renamed"Shenzhen East Lake Park". In 2015, with the approval of the municipal government, the name of Shenzhen East Lake Wetland Park (municipal level) was added.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:t,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[a("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[a("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),a("ul",null,[a("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: 6:00-23:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=a("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[a("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[a("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),l(s,{id:"64",data:[{id:"East Lake Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:t,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[r("East Lake Park")])),title1:i(({value:t,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[r("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:t,isActive:n})=>[l(o,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"East Lake Park",description:"The red line area of East Lake Park is now 152.59 hectares.
