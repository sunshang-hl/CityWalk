It is adjacent to the Futian Mangrove National Nature Reserve to the west and the Hong Kong Mai Po Nature Reserve, an internationally important wetland, to the south. Together, they are adjacent to the vast Shenzhen Bay area. The park covers an area of about 380,000 square meters and is divided into a tourist area, an ecological restoration area, and an ecological control area. It was officially opened to the public on December 26, 2015. As the surrounding area of the Futian National Nature Reserve, the district government is responsible for investment and implementation in line with the design concept of"ecological priority, combining art, popular science display, and easy management". In the"co-construction" model, it jointly built the Futian Mangrove Ecological Park with the Sixth Detachment of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Border Corps, the Shenzhen Public Security Border Detachment, the Municipal Radio and Television Group, the Futian District People's Armed Forces Department and other units, integrating popular science education, seaside culture, natural landscape, leisure and sightseeing. Cultural activities Public education is an important part of environmental protection. Through public education, the public"s ecological literacy can be improved and the seeds of hope for wetland conservation can be sown. When you come to Futian Mangrove Ecological Park, you can visit the Mangrove Science Exhibition Hall, feel the innocence of childhood at the Natural Power Park, participate in the park's nature classroom under the guidance of volunteers, and become a volunteer to participate in environmental creation and public science activities.`,-1)])),tab2:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[5]||(e[5]=[t("h3",{id:"opening-hours",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#opening-hours"},[t("span",null,"Opening Hours")])],-1),t("ul",null,[t("li",null,"Park Opening Hours: 6:00-23:00")],-1)])),_:1}),e[55]||(e[55]=t("h2",{id:"featured-attractions",tabindex:"-1"},[t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#featured-attractions"},[t("span",null,"Featured Attractions")])],-1)),r(o,{id:"64",data:[{id:"Futian Mangrove Ecological Park"},{id:"To be updated"}],"tab-id":"park-intro"},{title0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[6]||(e[6]=[l("Futian Mangrove Ecological Park")])),title1:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>e[7]||(e[7]=[l("To be updated")])),tab0:i(({value:a,isActive:n})=>[r(s,{image:"https://cgj.sz.gov.cn/images/index20230710_1.png",title:"Futian Mangrove Ecological Park",description:"The natural force park is about 1,100 square meters, with water wells, sand piles, plant trails, balance wood mazes, drawing blackboards, percussion instruments, low building block tables, leaf hanging ropes, butterfly and insect catching areas, wood block areas and other children-friendly amusement facilities.
