        description="1. The outdoor tennis court consists of 10 standard tennis courts. The main courts 1-6 are lined up in a row, open and grand. There are another 4 courts on the top of the mountain. 2. The central tennis court is a sunshade central court that can accommodate 600 spectators. The air is fresh and the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant. The passages between the courts are covered with green plants on the railings and walls, giving people the feeling of walking in the woods. The antique corridors connect all the courts to protect everyone from the wind and rain. It can be said that you don’t need to be afraid of the sun in the hot summer and don’t need to run away in the storm. 3. The indoor tennis hall is located next to the south gate of the beautiful East Lake Park and in the Luohu Sports Center in Shenzhen. It perfectly integrates green space, blue sky and tennis sports, forming a strong visual contrast with the tranquility of the park, and the momentum is like a rainbow. The second underground floor is a parking lot and civil air defense building. The second, third and roof floors are 7 indoor tennis courts, 3 outdoor tennis courts and 8 children’s short tennis courts, with a total construction area of 20,000 square meters and 200 underground parking spaces. The indoor tennis court has become an integrated, ecological, diverse and open community sports tennis court."
