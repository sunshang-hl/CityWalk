The library has special spaces such as the Starlight Bookstore, Picture Book Library, Public Reading Culture Experience Hall, Everyone's Study, and Audio Reading Space. Pingshan Cultural Village consists of libraries, art galleries, theaters, exhibition halls, cultural and creative experience halls, conference centers, bookstores, cinemas and other venues, covering an area of about 74,000 square meters.
