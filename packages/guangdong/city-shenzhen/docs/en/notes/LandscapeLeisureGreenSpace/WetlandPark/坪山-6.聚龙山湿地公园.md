    description="The A4 plot is themed on lake wetlands, allowing visitors to experience the beauty of rippling lakes and vast expanses of blue water. A large number of floating and emergent plants are planted in the areas where the water system runs through to form lakes. Exquisite greening attractions and landscape plank roads are set up between various forms of roads and water surfaces to coordinate with them, layer by layer, thus achieving a high-quality ecological environment with changing scenery and surrounding enclosures. The A5 plot is themed on forest wetlands, allowing visitors to experience the lush jungle beauty. A large number of aquatic mangrove vegetation are planted on both sides of the water system to form dense forests, which can not only provide visitors with a natural oxygen bar for quiet rest, but also attract various birds in the surrounding area to enrich the ecosystem. In conjunction with the bird-watching cabin, visitors can better understand the natural ecosystem."
