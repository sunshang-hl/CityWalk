After the wetland was built, it has a beautiful environment and fresh air. It has become a place for citizens in the surrounding area to enjoy the scenery and relax. It is also a popular science education base to promote the concept of water protection and love of water to citizens. The public green spaces, ecological corridors, fountains of life and landscape plants built in the wetland park often attract tourists to stop and watch.
