    description="The wooden boardwalk of Mangrove Warblers is the first viewing point when entering the OCT Wetland. Here, you can observe a diverse ecological environment such as reeds and mangroves, which are suitable for various animals to live. There are high-powered telescopes on the wooden boardwalk for tourists to experience; Dongtan is the largest tidal flat group in the wetland. The shallow water and tidal flat habitat attract many birds to stop and forage here, especially wading birds such as plovers and herons (black-winged stilts, greenshanks, recurvus, egrets, cattle egrets, etc.); Pinghu Feilu is the closest water-friendly viewing platform to the east gate of the wetland with a total length of about 70 meters. On both sides of the water-friendly platform, you can observe 7 types of mangroves in the OCT Wetland, namely: autumn candel, tung tree, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, acanthus sphagnum, bittern fern, sonneratia mulberry, and sonneratia apetala; Pianyingxuan is a bird-watching house hidden in the bushes. It is built with wooden materials and integrated with the natural environment. It is one of the best places for bird watching. During the migratory bird season (from November to April of the following year), photography enthusiasts come here to capture the beautiful moments of birds; Zero Road is located in the middle section of the original coastline of OCT Wetland, with a total length of about 600 meters.
