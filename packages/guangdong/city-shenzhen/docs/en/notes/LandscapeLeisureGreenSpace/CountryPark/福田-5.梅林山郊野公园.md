@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
 Meilin Mountain Country Park starts from Meiguan Expressway in the east, facing Yinhu Mountain across the road; it reaches the junction of Futian District and Nanshan District in the west, connecting with Tanglang Mountain Country Park; it starts from Nanping Expressway in the north and ends at Beihuan Road in the south. The middle part is divided into two parts by Meilin Reservoir and Water Source Protection Area, forming the southern and northern areas with a total area of about 6.9 square kilometers. The highest peak in the southern area of the park is 362 meters above sea level, and the highest peak in the northern area is 386 meters above sea level. The southern area was officially opened at the end of December 2013. Meilin Mountain Park is rich in forest resources and is an important treasure house of natural resources in our city. Meilin Mountain Park is dominated by ecological landscape and reservoir scenery. The main hiking trail in the southern area of the park is about 10 kilometers long and can go directly from Qiaoxiang Village to Meishan Garden and Tanglang Mountain Country Park. There are many recreational attractions along the way, such as Qinxiang Pavilion, Yicui Pavilion, Meiyu Pavilion, Wutao Pavilion, etc.; the northern area is still under construction, and the planned hiking trail will connect from the Second Line Pass Greenway in Nanshan District to Yinhu Mountain Country Park in Longhua District and Luohu District. Park Features Meilin Mountain Park is rich in forest resources. The main tree vegetation includes Linggu, Chenopodium album, Tallow Tree, False Sterculia, Autumn Maple, Schefflera, Camphora, Water Sprout, Yellow Milk Tree, etc.; the shrub vegetation includes Umbrella Tree, Variable Ficus, etc.; the national protected plants mainly include Cycad Fern, Clam Fern, Camphor Tree, Alsophila spinulosa, Gluewood, Golden Dogwood, White Cassia, etc.; the main artificial forests include Acacia, Schima superba, Litchi, etc. Meilin Mountain Park is an important natural resource treasure house in Shenzhen. The six major scenic spots of Meilin Yicai, Meishan Shiqu, Meifeng Liuxia, Meichuan Xizhao, Meiyun Juxiang, and Meihai Tingtao are scattered and varied, forming an ornamental plant community with different scenery at every step, showing the wildness of the park. The Meilin Mountain Country Trail is nearly 8 kilometers long and has two entrances, the Mei"ao entrance and the Meilin Back Mountain entrance. The main line is from the Litchi Forest entrance to the Big Head Shell, and the branch lines include the Nature Education Trail and the Qingfengling to Erxianguan entrance. It is mainly built in the form of a handmade trail, retaining the original wildness of the mountains and fields. Stone steps, steps, diversion crossbars, safety ropes and other construction methods are added to the steep slopes and other sections that are difficult to walk. Entrance signs, distance columns, map information boards, direction signs, etc. are set up along the way to maintain the original forest style to the greatest extent. Handmade trails not only reduce damage to nature, but also allow people who have lived in cities for a long time to have the opportunity to come into contact with the original nature.
