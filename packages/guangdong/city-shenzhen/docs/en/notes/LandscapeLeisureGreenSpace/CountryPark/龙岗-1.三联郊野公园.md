    description="The main entrance square of the park is about 6,940 square meters. The greenways around the mountains and around the lake in the park are the best places for jogging. The more than 1,000-meter-long aerial plank road has a sea of purple flowers at your feet. The rotating landscape platform - Mianyun Pavilion is also a great place to climb up and enjoy the scenery. From here, you can see the mountains and the bustling city landscape. The sunny lawn, or a piece of grass to sit on, allows you to enjoy the slow time in the suburbs of the city. It is very suitable for camping, kite flying, football, and badminton with friends and family."
