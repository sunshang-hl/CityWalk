    description="Yanhan Mountain Country Park is a rare treasure in the resort. There are acacia trees all over the mountain, lychee forests, bougainvillea, poinciana, kapok, frangipani, lotus, etc. in the park, which make Yanhan Mountain particularly beautiful. The lush flowers, birdsong, and flowing water here satisfy different types of climbers, walkers, and tourists. There are 5 different styles of hiking trails and mountain bike trails in the park. The mountain trails built along the mountain maximize the original appearance of the mountain and present the natural beauty without artificial carving. OCT Group has implanted the concept of ecology and low carbon into the design of the park, so that Yanhan Mountain Country Park has become one of the main green space resources of OCT Tourism Resort while providing a rest space for citizens, and undertakes the function of 'green lung' of the entire urban area."
