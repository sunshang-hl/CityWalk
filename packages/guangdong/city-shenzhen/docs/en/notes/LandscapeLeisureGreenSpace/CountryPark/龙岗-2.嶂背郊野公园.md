    description="There are two special scenic spots,'Walking Plank Road in the Clouds' and 'Lookout Tower', built in the mountaintop area. The Walking Plank Road in the Clouds is located on the southwest side of the park, with a total length of about 210 meters. The plank road combines the site terrain and height difference, viewing sights and experience, and is arranged with stopover viewing nodes and fast-pass plank roads, forming a multi-level spatial experience such as forests and forest ends, while also providing a viewing perspective overlooking the central city of Longgang. The Lookout Tower is located in the southwest corner of the park, 12.8 meters high, which is the highest point in the park, about 114 meters high. The tower body highlights the simple design language with vertical lines. The tower body is designed to be the highest of the three viewing floors, connected to which is a large-area observation and landscape platform on the second floor. You can travel between different floors through a spiral staircase to overlook the city scenery in nature."
