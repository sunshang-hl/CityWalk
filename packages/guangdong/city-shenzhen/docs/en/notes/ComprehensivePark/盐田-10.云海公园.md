    title="Sea of Clouds Park"
    description="The park has a beautiful environment, pleasant landscape and complex functions. It is located in the mountains and forests. It is not only a natural urban oxygen bar, but also has an 800-square-meter Yunhai Forest Service Station and an open lawn of more than 4,000 square meters, which can be used for leisure walks, mid-mountain reading, simple meals, etc., allowing citizens to get close to nature. The main building of the park uses the mountain as its peak and the momentum as its shape. The exterior adopts the concept of a ship, cleverly integrating local culture, implying the beautiful vision of Yantian District to set sail to the sea."
