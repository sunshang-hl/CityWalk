    description="(1) 'One mountain': With the mountain of the park as the core landscape carrier, multiple scenic spots and attractions are planned and designed around the 'one mountain'. The mountain plants are mainly red spring colors, creating a gorgeous landscape effect of the mountain during the spring equinox. (2) 'One ring': In combination with the park's terrain and recreational needs, a greenway and recreational ring line are set up, and recreational activities and major landscapes are carried out along the ring, providing a place for fitness and leisure for the surrounding residents. (3) 'Six scenes': With osmanthus as the theme, six planned scenic spots are planned in areas with relatively flat terrain and strong accessibility, namely: Nine-bend flower path, small mountain osmanthus, secluded mountain osmanthus, smelling osmanthus fragrance, streamside rock osmanthus, and moon palace laurel. (4) 'Multiple points': Along the recreational roads and scenic spots, multiple small rest areas for parking, appreciation, and activities are set up according to local conditions."
