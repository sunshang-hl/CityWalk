@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
 Shenzhen Bay Park is located on the coast of Shenzhen Bay in the southwest of Shenzhen City. It starts from the Futian Mangrove Bird Nature Reserve in the east, connects to Wanghai Road in the west, extends to the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Cross-sea Bridge in the south, and is adjacent to Binhai Avenue in the north. It is seamlessly connected with Talent Park, Shahe Leisure Belt, and West Extension. The park consists of two parts: the Mangrove Seaside Ecological Park built in 2000 and the Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt built in 2011. The total area is about 128.74 hectares, along the coastline for about 13 kilometers, with 14 theme parks. The Mangrove Seaside Ecological Park was built in 1999 and officially opened to the public in December 2000. It covers an area of about 20.67 hectares. The original site of the park was the tidal flat in the north of Shenzhen Bay, which was reclaimed for the construction of Binhai Avenue. In order to protect the mangroves, the Shenzhen Municipal Government moved Binhai Avenue, which was originally planned to pass through the mangroves, to the north by more than 200 meters, and transformed the reclaimed roadbed to the west into today"s Mangrove Seaside Ecological Park. The Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt covers an area of about 108.07 hectares, with 14 different themed areas planned. From east to west, there are Mangrove Seaside Ecological Park, Zhongwan Yuehai Square, Haiyun Garden, Bailupo, Beiwan Lugang, Xiaoshashan, Dayun Torch Tower, Liuhua Mountain, Crescent Valley, Sunrise Theater, Tidal Wetland, Wedding Square, Seaview Pier, and Sea Breeze Sports Square. All the themed areas are connected in series through a complete walking and cycling system. Shenzhen Bay Park connects the sea and the city, and connects birds and humans. It is a contemporary, iconic and ecological green coastal promenade in Shenzhen. It is a new urban cultural business card of Shenzhen that embodies the integration of ecology and humanity. It will fully release and show the infinite charm of Shenzhen's modern coastal city.
