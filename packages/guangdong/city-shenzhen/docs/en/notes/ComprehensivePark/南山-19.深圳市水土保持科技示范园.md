- Park Introduction: Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Technology Demonstration Park (hereinafter referred to as 'Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Park') is located in Xili Street, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, adjacent to the southwest side of Xili Reservoir. In order to implement the scientific development concept, improve the ecological environment, and respond to the call of the Ministry of Water Resources to build soil and water conservation technology demonstration parks across the country, in accordance with the relevant arrangements of the municipal government, Shenzhen Water Affairs Bureau and Nanshan District People's Government started the construction of Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Park in 2008, and the park was opened to the public in October 2009. Shenzhen Soil and Water Conservation Park is the first demonstration park in my country with the theme of urban soil and water conservation work. It focuses on displaying the achievements of Shenzhen's soil and water conservation work since the 1990s. It is an important base and display window for Shenzhen to promote ecological civilization construction and water situation education and publicity. In March 2009, Shenzhen Water Conservation Park was named"National Soil and Water Conservation Science and Technology Demonstration Shenzhen Water Conservation Park" by the Ministry of Water Resources; in February 2012, it was jointly named"National Soil and Water Conservation Education Social Practice Base for Primary and Secondary School Students" by the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Education; in July 2012, it was awarded the"Chairman"s Award" in the 9th International Landscape Management Category by the Asia-Pacific Conference of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA); in April 2013, it was listed as the 'Guangdong Province Soil and Water Loss Monitoring Point of the National Soil and Water Conservation Monitoring Network and Information System Construction (Phase II) Project'; in May 2016, it was named"National Water Situation Education Base" by the Ministry of Water Resources; in November 2017, it was rated as the"National Soil and Water Conservation Science Education Base" by the China Soil and Water Conservation Society; in November 2017, it became a"member unit of the National Water Conservancy Museum Alliance"; in October 2020, it became the"Nanshan District Young Pioneers Off-campus Practice Base". Cultural activities: Shenzhen Water Conservation Park holds special education and publicity activities every year, targeting different social groups such as primary and secondary school students and the public, and carries out theme activities such as"True Protection, Love My Water and Soil","Love Water and Protect Soil, It"s Your Responsibility, Start with Every Little Thing to Do to Protect Forests and Greenery","Youth in Action, Dedicate Beautiful Water to Shenzhen" and so on;"Water and Soil Conservation Enters the Community","Find the Most Beautiful Things Around You, Show the Original Ecology of the City""Creative Cup" Photography Competition,"Ecological New Year"s Day, Fun Water Conservation Tour" Ecological Garden Party,"World Water Day","China Water Week" theme activities,"National Urban Water Conservation Promotion Week","Water and Soil Conservation Enters Campus","Building Dreams in Shenzhen, Love Water Conservation" hand-painted competition publicity activities and other theme publicity activities with rich content and novel forms, and strive to build a national publicity and education system of 'everyone participates, everyone benefits".

    description="1. The Water and Soil Culture Exhibition Area builds four theme parks by drawing on the four elements of earth, wood, metal and water in nature, presents water and soil culture with novel landscape simulation design techniques, expresses the essence of the mutual growth and harmony of all things in nature in modern language, builds a platform for the public to get close to water and soil conservation, and creates a water and soil world where people and nature coexist harmoniously, and is fascinating and thought-provoking. 2. The Water and Soil Conservation Science Exhibition Area uses ingenious ideas, takes the formation, form, harm and control of soil erosion as the main design line, and uses visual processing techniques to centrally arrange water and soil erosion simulation facilities, plant root box display facilities, water and soil conservation measures display facilities, runoff observation facilities, etc. (1) The Water and Soil Erosion Simulation Facility Exhibition Area uses slope steep trough facilities and combines artificial simulated rainfall to show the process of raindrops splashing on different slopes and vegetation-covered surfaces to produce water and soil erosion, so that visitors can have an intuitive understanding of water and soil conservation and improve their awareness of water and soil conservation and ecological environmental protection. (2) Plant root box display facilities use transparent plant root boxes to display the root morphology and growth conditions of different vegetation types. (3) The soil and water conservation engineering measures display area takes engineering and plant measures as the two main lines, and sets up slope protection engineering and ditch protection engineering display areas to display traditional soil and water conservation technical measures and modern urban soil and water conservation technical measures. On the one hand, it allows visitors to systematically understand various soil and water conservation measures, and on the other hand, it highlights the regional and targeted nature of various soil and water conservation measures. (4) Runoff test plot The runoff test plot was set up on the slope at the tail of the Xili Reservoir, which was listed as the 'Guangdong Province Soil and Water Loss Monitoring Point of the Second Phase of the National Soil and Water Conservation Monitoring Network and Information System Construction Project'. A total of 8 standard runoff plots with a slope of 22.5 degrees were set up in the plot, with five types of sites, including bare land, natural grassland, artificial grassland, arbor forest, and mixed forest of arbor, shrub and grass. Under each plot, a collection pool, diversion pool, and collection trough were installed, which is suitable for soil and water loss observation under different vegetation types. 3. Sponge City Science and Technology Demonstration Education Base This area continues the water and soil cultural concepts of the first phase of the project and introduces life factors to vividly depict the close relationship between water, soil and life to visitors. By constructing entrance squares and rainwater gardens, stepped classrooms, urban construction soil and water conservation galleries, soil and water conservation botanical gardens and other facilities, it introduces and demonstrates more professional soil and water conservation principles and technological innovations and applications, increases public participation in soil and water conservation and water situation publicity, highlights scientific research content, enhances the scientific and technological content of Shenzhen Water Conservation Park, builds a sponge city science and technology demonstration education base, and provides a publicity platform for the city's urban soil and water conservation construction and ecological civilization construction."
