(2) The 'Roman columns' landscape buildings on both sides of the square, and the constellation culture carved above the Roman columns. (3) The ancient Greek statues erected outside the small theater on the southwest side of the square are lifelike, attracting people to pursue ancient Greek mythology and learn about Western culture. (4) The clock tower in the south of the square has dials with Roman numerals on the top of the clock tower.
