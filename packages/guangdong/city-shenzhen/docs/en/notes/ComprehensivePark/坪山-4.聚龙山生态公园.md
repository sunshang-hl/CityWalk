@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
 Julongshan Ecological Park is located north of Qingsong West Road and south of Jinxiu West Road. The construction of the park mainly follows two main lines: the humanistic axis of"dragon culture" and the natural axis of"local diversity". Combined with the scope of time and space, it has evolved into the"green dragon concept" and formed the theme of the park -"Green Dragon Garden". The park has rich plant species. There are more than 100 kinds of trees such as cherry blossoms, bauhinia, syzygium, black ink, cinnamomum camphora, etc. on both sides of the road and on the hillside. The commanding height of Julongshan Ecological Park is Jiulongding Square, which is a flat land on the top of the mountain. Standing on the square, you can see the fertile fields nearby, the urban area, mountains and sea of clouds in the distance. Walking around the square, you can see the beautiful scenery of Pingshan New District.

    description="Dragon Soaring and Dancing ' Sculpture: The main body of the Dragon Soaring and Dancing Sculpture is cast in bronze, with a total height of 8.18 meters and a dragon pool diameter of 12.88 meters. The sculpture is rooted in Chinese traditional culture and its shape is inspired by the romantic poem of Li Bai, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, 'The flute plays the dragon and the water sings, the flute sings the phoenix and the sky descends', which is very inspiring. The sculpture shows the social outlook of Pingshan New District, where dragons soar and tigers leap, people live happily and well, and the development vision of ecological civilization that is close to nature. Dragons soar in Pingshan, music dances in the south sky; prosperity and auspiciousness, endless happiness! The Nine Dragon Tripod is the biggest highlight of the park. Almost every visitor to the park will take a photo with the Nine Dragon Tripod."
