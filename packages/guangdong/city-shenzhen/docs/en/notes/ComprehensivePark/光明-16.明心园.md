### Park Overview
- Region: Guangming District
- Park Category: City Park
- Park Tags: Community Park Featured Book Bar
- Detailed Address: 180 meters west of the intersection of Mingzheng Road and Guangqiao Road, Guangming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen
- Park Introduction: Mingxin Garden is located at the intersection of Mingzheng Road and Guangqiao Road, Guangming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen. Mingxin Garden uses auspicious clouds and curves as design texture elements, continuing the landscape axis of the Guangming District Public Service Platform City Square, forming an open and urban landscape space. The existing height difference problem is cleverly handled through the combination of terraces and cultural walls, forming a leisure viewing platform with different heights; overall, the spatial function of the area is more perfect. From a functional point of view, the city square is the distribution square and"urban living room" of the public service platform, and Mingxin Garden is the"front garden" of the public service platform. From the perspective of sight, a three-dimensional freehand humanistic painting with Guangming characteristics is formed. In terms of functional layout, the courtyard-style opening and closing space combination is emphasized, the streamline is smooth and transparent, and the local focus is on the activity function venue. The entire park is divided into four areas: the Happy Living Vitality Stage, the Auspicious Cloud Leisure and Government Visit Activity Area, the Wisdom Vitality Science Education Area, and the Mountaintop Recreation Area. Landscape leisure garden architecture focuses on multi-functional integration, and sets up multi-functional earth-covered structures and viewing platforms, which not only meet social functional needs, but also emphasize landscape leisure functions, while considering natural ecological functions. The greening style is simple and modern. It takes the original greening trees as the base and protects and utilizes the native trees on the mountain as much as possible. Xiangyun Square is dominated by clustered Chinese hackberry, and adopts the configuration of trees + lawns and flowers to create a comfortable and transparent space atmosphere. The main entrance square and the science and culture square on the west side are based on evergreen trees such as camphor and autumn maple, and flowering trees such as poinciana are planted to create a magnificent sea of flowers.
