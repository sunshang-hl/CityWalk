    description="Wuzhiba Park covers an area of more than 1,800 mu, with a 5.2-kilometer greenway, 8 scenic spots, 14 hiking trails, a viewing corridor bridge and a glass trail. The park has the Wuzhiba Reservoir, clear water and green mountains, and elegant gardens. A three-story antique building, Songyun Building, is built on the top of the mountain. Climbing up the Songyun Building, you can see the surrounding Songgang scenery from afar, which is pleasant and exciting. Next to the reservoir, there is a Lingnan courtyard with antique style, pavilions, towers, and waterside rockery, which reminds people of Jiangnan gardens. A tower stands tall, reflecting the characteristics of Lingnan architecture."
