@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
 The Performing Arts Park is located in the Guiwan area of Qianhai, covering an area of 139,000 square meters. It is adjacent to Dachan Bay in the west, Shuangjie River in the north, and Guiwan River in the south. It is a coastal and reclaimed area. The soil is highly salinized, which is very unfavorable to the growth and development of plants. A total of 15 φ300PVC double-threaded seepage pipes are set up vertically and horizontally as salt drainage pipes throughout the entire range of the Performing Arts Park. The distance between the salt drainage pipes is about 50m, and the slope is 1%. It is adjusted in combination with the terrain. At the same time, by selecting plant varieties suitable for saline-alkali land, a coastal park with coconut breeze and sea charm is created. Qianhai Performing Arts Park, formerly known as Seaside Park, faces Qianhai Bay Beach in the west, where you can enjoy the beautiful sea view; the northwest side is opposite to Bao'an Happy Harbor, which can be said to be one of the best locations to watch the giant Ferris wheel"Light of the Bay Area"; the east and southeast are adjacent to the Qianhai Financial Center building complex.
