It is currently a small natural mountain with an area of about 56,000 square meters. The mountain is well covered with vegetation and has a natural harbor, which is suitable for the survival and reproduction of birds. There are many kinds of birds living on it. In order to protect the excellent natural environment of the place, meet the leisure requirements of surrounding residents, and accelerate the pace of international urban development, Yantian District has established a project to build Yandunshan International Friendship Park.

The original buildings on the site are transformed into an International Friendship Center. A map hollow wall and a terraced rock garden are arranged in the International Friendship Square to showcase the mapping history and coastal rock landforms of the friendly cities. At the same time, in the International Friendship Garden, the Hercules Lighthouse in La Coruña is used as a prototype and is scaled down in proportion as a witness to the friendship between the two countries."
