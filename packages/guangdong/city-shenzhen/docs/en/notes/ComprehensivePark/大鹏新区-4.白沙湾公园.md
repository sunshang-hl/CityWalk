    description="1. Beautiful mountain and sea scenery Baisha Bay Park has protected plants such as water hyacinth, silver-leafed trees and ancient banyan trees that are growing luxuriantly and have great conservation value, as well as tidal flat protection areas for protected animals such as egrets and white-headed bulbuls. The park has a coastal greenway that runs east-west. The Baguang area is surrounded by mountains and is close to the mountains and water. It is the best place in Shenzhen to preserve the complete ecosystem of 'coastline-wetland-mountain and wilderness'. Baisha Bay Park is surrounded by mountains on the north, south and west sides, and the east side is an excellent viewing point for mountain and sea scenery. It has a landscape of mountains and sea, and a coastline of more than 1.2 kilometers that stretches and twists, showing tourists a natural mountain and sea landscape. Here we can see the scenery, see things, watch birds, appreciate plants, and watch the beach, and feel a completely different attitude and lifestyle from the city, and experience the beauty of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. 2. Helicopter landing pad The park has a helicopter landing pad, which is located in the northeast of Baguang Baisha Bay Park, overlooking Baguang Bay, and covers an area of 2,400 square meters. The helipad has been incorporated into the Baguang air medical rescue system, and is responsible for major rescue missions such as maritime rescue, emergencies, and remote rescue. It also has uses in firefighting, disaster relief, and business. It plays an important role in promoting the development of general aviation in Baguang and the new district and building integrated three-dimensional transportation by sea, land, and air."
