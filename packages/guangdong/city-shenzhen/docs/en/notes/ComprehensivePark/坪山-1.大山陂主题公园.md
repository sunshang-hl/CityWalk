- Park Introduction: Dashanpi Theme Park is located in the south and north areas of Dashanpi Reservoir in Pingshan District. The south area is adjacent to Maluanshan Country Park, and the north area is adjacent to Pingshan Sports Center on No. 8 Road. The north and south areas of the park are connected by the Dashanpi Lake Greenway, including jogging and cycling paths, with a total length of about 6.8 kilometers. Along the route, viewing platforms are built in locations with excellent forest resources and lake views, opening up the water interface, shortening the distance between people and water, and building a slow-moving system that integrates ecological, cultural, leisure, and sports functions. The Greenway connects resources such as Taihe Tower, Lake Pavilion, Maluanshan Country Park, Sculpture Art Park, and Sports Center inside and outside the park, and uses the superior natural conditions of Dashanpi Reservoir and Maluan Mountain Range to form a natural green tree-lined, bird-accompanied running sanctuary, which is also a good place for citizens to relax, entertain, and exercise. Dashanpi Theme Park is built around the lake and is located among the mountains. It is not only a natural barrier for urban flood control, but also an ecological back garden for leisure and entertainment. Cultural activities: Dashanpi Theme Park can provide tourists with hiking, running, cycling, team-organized walking activities and parent-child activities, etc.
