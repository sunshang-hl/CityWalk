    description="The park uses methods of combining near and far, staggered and colorful plant landscaping, and has planted more than 5,000 trees such as Podocarpus, Delonix regia, and Kapok, with a green area of 90,000 square meters. It has built a vibrant ecological urban forest in the Qingshui River area, filling the gap of the Qingshui River area for a long time without large green spaces and parks, and creating a green and fragrant mountain in the urban area. At the same time, the park has also built a mountain path, a mountaineering path, a mountaintop leisure square, and a green automatic irrigation system, a safety monitoring system, etc., integrating ecological protection, entertainment and leisure, and sports and fitness, providing citizens with a beautiful leisure activity space and enjoying a harmonious life close to nature. Honggang Park will create a Jacaranda theme park, and the park will plant Jacaranda on a large scale from July 2018."
