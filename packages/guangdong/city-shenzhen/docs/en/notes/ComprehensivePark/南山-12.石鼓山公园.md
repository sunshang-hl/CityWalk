- Park Introduction: Shigushan Park, located in Qingguwan, Xili, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, is also known as 'Shigushan'. It is adjacent to Shahe West Road in the east, Xinguang Road in the south, Shigu Road in the west, and Liuxian Avenue in the north, covering an area of more than 137,000 square meters. In the old days, the bay was full of strange rocks, the river was winding, and it was natural. In the middle of the bay, there was a mountain that was 76 meters high, 400 meters long from east to west, and 250 meters wide from north to south. According to legend, there was a large bluestone in the north of the mountain, which looked like a drum, so it was named 'Shigushan'. From ancient times to the present, Shigushan is located in the center of Xili, witnessing the glory of Xili"s transformation from a remote town to a modern city. There is still a well-preserved bunker on the top of the mountain, which is in a unique and hidden location. Looking around, you can see everything. In 2007, the Nanshan District Committee and District Government of Shenzhen City, adhering to the people-oriented concept, worked hard to create"Harmonious Nanshan, Efficient Nanshan, and Ecological Nanshan" and established the project to build Shigushan Park, which was completed and opened at the end of 2008. The park is carefully planned and built on the mountain. It is a comprehensive leisure park consisting of native lychee forests, new green belts, mountain trails, squares, landscape pavilions, and corridors. The park's functions are mainly mountaineering and leisure, highlighting the"static" cultural atmosphere, supplemented by fitness equipment and fitness cobblestone paths. In May 2021, Shigushan Park was jointly awarded the title of 'Guangdong Province Rule of Law Culture Theme Park" by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Justice, Guangdong Provincial Department of Culture and Tourism, and Guangdong Provincial Legal Education Office.
