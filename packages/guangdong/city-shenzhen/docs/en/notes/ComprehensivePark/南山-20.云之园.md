@tab:active Park Overview
### Park Overview
- Region: Nanshan District
- Park Category: City Park
- Park Tags: Community Park Featured Book Bar Sports
- Detailed Address: Keji South Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, Guangdong
- Park Introduction: The Cloud Garden takes 'cloud' as its design theme, and its plane layout is based on the deformation of clouds. The main colors are technology blue, cloud white, and high-grade gray. Elements such as cloud shapes, pixels, and streamlines outline a landscape space that integrates modernity, nature, and technology. The entire park is divided into one axis, two lines, and four zones. One axis is the pixel axis, the two lines are the smart cloud trail and the health track, and the four zones are the leisure and entertainment area, the early creek exploration area, the activity lawn area, and the blue garden area. The sky becomes colorful and shadowy because of clouds, technology becomes wise and intelligent because of clouds; ecology becomes poetic because of clouds: life becomes perfect and beautiful because of clouds.
