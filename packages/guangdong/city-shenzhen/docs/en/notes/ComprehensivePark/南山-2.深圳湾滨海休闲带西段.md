    title="Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt West Section"
    description="The western section of the Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt transforms the original productive coastline into a public space with rich community activities and place spirit, becoming a diversified and flexible waterfront leisure belt. It uses the  'bay' theme space language and environmental landscape intention to enrich the coastline characteristics of the coastal leisure belt and the corresponding waterfront functional activity space. The park is divided into four areas, D, E, F, and G, from east to southwest. Several parks, docks, squares, and greenways are connected in series along the line, which enhances the natural landscape environment of the city and creates different landscape theme characteristics. The 'natural park' in section D, where the water and sky are one color, enters the natural park through the central estuary bridge, and experiences a beautiful large lawn, a central estuary corridor bridge with smooth curves and gradient steel pipes, and an exquisite horticultural garden, reflecting the landscape garden of the city's development and changing skyline. The 'ecological corridor' in section E is a staggered 'ecological corridor'. This section is in the form of a bay, adjacent to Shekou Mountain, and combined with small buildings and pedestrian system settings, it has become an important ecological corridor where the mountain and the bay meet. The white lighthouse in the  'Lighthouse Square' of Section F is the original building of the site that has been preserved, suggesting the former function of the waterway. The Lighthouse Square is connected to the commercial and leisure pedestrian street next to it, becoming a vibrant landmark in this area. The  'Fishing Sea Boardwalk' of Section G focuses on local fishing, boats, docks and other fishery infrastructure, and is built into landscape nodes such as the Fishing Sea Boardwalk, Shekou Garden, and Dock Park, which are characterized by the local fishing culture of Shekou."
