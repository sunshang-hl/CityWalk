    description="At present, there are 4 5-a-side football fields, 1 7-a-side football field, and 1 11-a-side football field in the park, with a sports functional area of about 12,000 square meters. The fields are all built with high-standard artificial grass combined with high-specification sizes to meet the requirements of hosting large-scale events, football training, daily sports, etc. On the green field, a football is flying under the feet of the teenagers, the young athletes are running and sweating as hard as they can, the cheers of the audience on the sidelines are inspiring, and the laughter and joy have become the main theme of youth. This is a 'new business card' of Hangcheng - the Lion Mountain Park Football Field in Hangcheng Street. As an important livelihood project of Hangcheng Street, the construction and opening of the football field has set off a national fitness craze in the street area, met the people's needs for civilized and healthy life, enhanced their sense of gain, happiness, and security, and further consolidated the construction of urban community sports facilities, which has made a guarantee for the popularization and acceptance of the development of Hangcheng football. In addition, the park has convenient transportation and complete supporting service functions, and is equipped with parking lots, toilets, shower rooms and other facilities. The public welfare nature of the park will effectively improve the comprehensive benefits of football field facilities, and it is planned to build Lion Rock Park into the first football theme park in Hangcheng Street with professional venues, pleasant landscapes and green ecology."
