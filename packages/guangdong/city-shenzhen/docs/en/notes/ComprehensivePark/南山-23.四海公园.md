### Park Overview
- Region: Nanshan District
- Park Category: City Park
- Park Tags: Sports Featured Book Bar Pet Park
- Detailed Address: No. 82-2, Gongyuan Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen
- Inquiry Phone: 0755-26883923
- Park Introduction: Sihai Park was built in 1987, with a total area of 135,710.39 square meters. It is the earliest park built in the Shekou area and one of the first parks in China to be open to the public free of charge. In 2018, the Nanshan District Urban Management and Comprehensive Law Enforcement Bureau carried out an overall renovation and upgrading of Sihai Park, turning it into a central lakeside park for all ages and"borderless". The park is centered on the Golden Bull, supplemented by the East and West Lakes, and features a large area of lychee trees. It is dotted with traditional Chinese pavilions, terraces, corridors, bridges, and stones to form a garden landscape with Lingnan ethnic style. The"World-class Golden Bull" is 30 meters high, with a fireball on its back, standing in the center of the park with a frown, showing the pioneering spirit of reform and opening up; it is based on one bull, one terrace, two lakes, three bridges, four gardens, four statues, and five pavilions, with the plank road around the lake and the fitness track as the veins, and small bridges and flowing water, which makes people linger. Although the park is not big, it has trees, water, flowers, grass, and the chirping of insects and birds, highlighting the tranquility of the surrounding environment. The sound of reading from Yucai No. 2 Middle School further highlights the bookish atmosphere of the park.
