    description="There is a stage in the park. In addition, the park is equipped with one national defense education children's entertainment facility, one table tennis room, one basketball court, one tennis court, one badminton court and other entertainment and fitness facilities to facilitate residents to hold various cultural and sports activities and fitness exercises. The park is densely covered with trees and rich vegetation. The hiking trail from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain is replaced by elegantly designed winding corridors and viewing platforms. There is a white artistic landscape made of steel pipes in the small square on the top of the mountain. It looks like the dancing wings of a butterfly, set off by the blue sky, green plants and orange corridors. It is harmonious and smart, and very eye-catching."
