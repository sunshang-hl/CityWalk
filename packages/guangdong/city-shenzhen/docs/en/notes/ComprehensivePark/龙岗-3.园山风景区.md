    title="Yuanshan Scenic Area"
    description="The main peak of Yuanshan, 599 meters above sea level, is 1.58 kilometers away from the highest peak of Longgang, Egongji (618 meters above sea level). There are two valleys, Dakang Valley and Laohugou, between the two peaks. There are mountain streams flowing down the stream all year round, with green trees, gurgling water, white waterfalls like smoke, like a girl's skirt, and mountain springs gurgling, as if someone is playing 'big and small pearls falling on a jade plate'. The terrain here is dangerous, the forests are lush, and the depths are unpredictable. Whenever the mountain wind blows, the forest waves roll like the roar of a tiger and the roar of a dragon."
