    description="The park design includes functional areas such as the entrance display area, core square area, water-friendly platform area, water recreation area, and sparse forest area, which can meet the needs of different tourists. In addition, modern new Chinese style elements are incorporated to restore the old buildings on the bank of the pool and around the square, and the later modern-style small buildings are transformed into Lingnan residential style facades to coordinate with the original village pattern and appearance, forming a community park with both practicality and Lingnan sentiment. The park has completed the construction of ground paving, waterfront activity space, courtyard space, entrance platform and archway, rockery and flowing water, trestle and pavilion, which fully improved the surrounding landscape environment of the community, provided a place for rest and activities for surrounding residents, and reshaped the spiritual core of Guanlan Ancient Village."
