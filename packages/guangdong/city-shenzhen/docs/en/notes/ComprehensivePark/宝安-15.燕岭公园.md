@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
 Yanling Park is located in the northern part of Yanchuan Community, surrounded by the bustling Yanjing Market, roads with endless traffic, residential houses, and dense shops and factories. But as long as you are willing, you can step over the noise and enter a quiet and green world in less than ten minutes. Yanling Park is a park in Yanchuan Community. Like countless community parks in Shenzhen, it does not have the beauty of lakes and mountains, but is quiet in the bustle, either by the mountains or by the lake. Yanling Park is different from other parks. The builders are ingenious, and all the facilities are related to swallows. When you come here, even if you don’t see swallows, there will always be swallows flying in front of you, and your ears seem to be filled with the whispers of swallows.
