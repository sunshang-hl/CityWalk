@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
The Shenzhen Bay Greenway is located along the picturesque Shenzhen Bay in the southwestern coastal area of Shenzhen. It stretches from the Futian District's Mangrove Bird Nature Reserve in the east to Sea World in Nanshan District in the west, covering approximately 19.6 kilometers along the coastline (including the 6.6-kilometer western section of the coastal leisure belt). The greenway features separate walking and cycling paths, catering to the needs of different groups. It connects dozens of theme parks, piers, squares, and scenic spots along its route. The lush vegetation along the shore allows visitors to enjoy the sea, listen to the gentle waves lapping against the embankment, watch seabirds soaring, relax by the shore, or gaze at the islands of Hong Kong in the distance. The greenway also offers views of the Shenzhen Bay Bridge and the grandeur of the Universiade Spring Cocoon, as well as access to Shekou Port and Sea World. The Shenzhen Bay Greenway is a contemporary and iconic coastal (waterfront) greenway in Shenzhen, serving as a new cultural landmark that embodies the integration of ecology and humanity. It fully showcases the boundless charm of Shenzhen as a modern coastal city.

The western section of the Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt, spanning 6.6 kilometers from the estuary of the Central River to the Nanhai Hotel, officially opened to the public in July 2017. The park's greenway includes separate walking and cycling paths to accommodate different visitors. It links numerous theme parks, piers, squares, and scenic spots along its route, earning it the reputation as the most beautiful urban coastline.

Situated in the southeastern part of Nanshan District, the Shenzhen Bay Coastal Leisure Belt faces Shenzhen Bay and overlooks Hong Kong. It is the only densely urbanized coastal belt within the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. With its coconut groves, coastal boardwalks, and scenes of fish leaping and egrets flying, the area offers a year-round experience of "facing the sea, with spring blossoms in full bloom."
