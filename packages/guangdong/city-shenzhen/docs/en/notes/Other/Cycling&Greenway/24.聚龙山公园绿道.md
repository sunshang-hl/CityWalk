@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
The Julongshan Park Greenway encircles the Julongshan Ecological Park, spanning approximately 6 kilometers in length. The main section of the Julongshan Park Greenway is located at the border between Pingshan and Kengzi in Pingshan District, north of Qingsong West Road and south of Jinxiu West Road. The greenway boasts a rich variety of flora and fauna, surrounded by lush mountains and clear waters. The route primarily consists of the Julongshan mountain and Julong Lake, seamlessly connecting the mountain and water landscapes. Along the greenway, the mountain slopes are adorned with over a hundred species of trees, including Syzygium cumini, Tabebuia chrysantha, Delonix regia, Michelia alba, Terminalia mantaly, Celtis sinensis, and Bischofia javanica. The landscape is further enriched with a diverse array of ornamental plants such as Michelia figo, Ixora chinensis, Loropetalum chinense var. rubrum, Bougainvillea spectabilis, Osmanthus fragrans, as well as ground cover species like Gypsophila paniculata, Cynodon dactylon, Axonopus compressus, Zoysia matrella, and Lantana camara.

Strolling leisurely along the greenway not only offers an immersive experience of the majestic mountains and waters, allowing one to feel the vastness and depth of nature, but also provides an opportunity to learn about the "Dragon Culture" along the route, appreciating the profound heritage of the local landscape. The greenway is designed to highlight its unique features by integrating the "Dragon Culture" as a cultural axis and the "Local Biodiversity" as a natural axis, reflecting the distinctive characteristics of Julongshan Park.
