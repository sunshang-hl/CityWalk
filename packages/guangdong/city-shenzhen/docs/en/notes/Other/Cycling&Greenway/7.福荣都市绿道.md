@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
Why venture far for a spring outing when the urban greenway is a perfect destination? The Furong Urban Greenway, transformed from the noise barrier forest belt of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway, stretches from Xinzhu Road in the east to the Mangrove Forest in the west. Spanning 3.08 kilometers and covering an area of 102,700 square meters, it traverses seven communities—Cuiwan, Shawei, Shazui, Jindi, Shangsha, Xiasha, and Jinbi—benefiting over 300,000 residents along its route. This greenway is a public welfare project of Futian District, enhancing both the greenway construction and the legacy of the Universiade. With a focus on "nature, ecology, and elegance," it features a forested ecological environment, scientifically planned while preserving the original ecosystem. The project involved clearing waterways, reorganizing vegetation, setting up scenic spots, and improving facilities, and was completed in July 2011. The greenway is divided into three thematic areas:

1. **Sports Zone**: This area includes a children's playground, skate park, Tai Chi square, chess garden, fitness square, gateball court, bicycle path, and jogging trail.
2. **Leisure Stroll Zone**: Featuring distinctive pergolas and wooden boardwalks, this zone is vibrant and meticulously laid out. The winding forest paths, scenic pavilions, and bridges are interspersed with lush trees and blooming flowers, creating a serene atmosphere for chess and dance.
3. **Cultural Zone**: This area showcases the historical roots and folk customs of nearby urban villages like Shangsha, Xiasha, Shazui, and Shawei through cultural relief walls and thematic sculptures.

In summary, the Furong Greenway offers convenient access, comprehensive infrastructure, and beautiful scenery, making it an ideal harmonious green space for residents to connect with nature, engage in leisure exercises, stroll, and relax.
