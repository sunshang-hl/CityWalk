@tab Park Introduction
### Park Introduction
The Banshan Greenway in Yantian District (Enshang to Yantian High School Section) starts at Shatoujiao Forest Farm and ends at Yantian High School, with a total length of approximately 9 kilometers. The project combines renovation and new construction, using slow-moving pathways as a link to connect greenways and hiking trails, creating both small and large loops. Ultimately, it integrates one wetland park landscape node, three parks (nodes), eight mountain-sea viewing platforms, and eight hiking entrances. This project is organically connected with the city's premium urban belt and coastal leisure belt, scientifically utilizing the natural resources of mountains and seas to create a unique ecological project that allows visitors to "leisurely ascend halfway up the mountain and enjoy a panoramic view of the mountains, sea, and city." To benefit more residents and tourists, the greenway has established a slow-walking trail system that caters to different target groups with varying lengths and experiences. By connecting key nodes such as hiking entrances, viewing platforms, and reservoirs through the trail system, and adding fire lookout points and forest protection stations, a scientifically comprehensive forest protection system has been built. This not only effectively utilizes fire patrol roads but also enhances the convenience and comfort for residents and tourists to access mountain and forest spaces and experience natural resources. The Enshang section of the Banshan Park Belt differs from typical hiking landscape belts. To highlight Yantian's unique mountain-sea resource advantages and enrich visitors' sensory experiences, the greenway adopts "Listening to Yantian" as its main design concept. By creating interactive nodes between humans and nature and setting up distinctive landscapes integrated into the forest, the project carries out protective development tailored to local conditions. It fully leverages Yantian's exceptional mountain-sea resources to create a slow-walking belt landscape that "embraces the mountains and sea, sharing the sounds of nature," continuously advancing the construction of a beautiful Yantian and building a desirable urban area where "the city is in the garden, and the garden is in the city."
